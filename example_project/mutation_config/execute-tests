# A simple example on how to set up an "execute-tests" hook

# Go to the example project root directory
# (You probably shouldn't use a relative path in a real project though)
cd ..

# Build tests
make

# Run tests
target/test

# Move the test output to "test-results" in root of the mutation_output folder
# (which is where the tool expects to find it after calling this test hook).
#
# NOTE: In a real project, this file could instead for example be concatenated from
#       multiple result file(s) generated by a test framework.
#
#       Time stamps and other such "moving parts" must be stripped from the file,
#       otherwise two tests executions will always seem to differ when compared!
#
mv target/test_results.log mutation_output/test-results
